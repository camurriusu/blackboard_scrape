# Blackboard scraper
Scrapes links of pdf and pptx files from a Blackboard course page using Selenium that follows previously seen structure and downloads them in organised folders on your drive.
- I advise to read through `script.py` and make any necessary changes once you download the script.
- Make sure you install any necessary dependencies such as `pip install selenium` etc.
